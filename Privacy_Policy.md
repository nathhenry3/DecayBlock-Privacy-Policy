# DecayBlock-Privacy-Policy
Privacy policy for DecayBlock browser extension

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy describes how the DecayBlock browser extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information.

**1. Information We Collect**

The DecayBlock extension does not collect any personally identifiable information about its users.

The only data the extension collects and stores is non-personally identifiable and is stored locally within your browser's storage. This data is essential for the extension's functionality and includes:

- A list of websites that you have chosen to block or apply a friction-based timeout to.

- The timeout settings that you have configured.

- A timestamped history of friction delays, which is used to generate the chart on the blocked.html page.

This information is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

The locally stored data is used exclusively to enable the core features of the DecayBlock extension:

The site list allows the extension to detect when you are trying to visit a website you have flagged and to apply the appropriate action (friction or permanent block).

Your settings are used to customize the decay algorithm to your preferences.

The friction delay history is used to provide you with a visual record of your past interactions with the extension's friction feature.

**3. Information Sharing**

Because all data is stored locally in your browser, no user data is shared with any third party. We have no access to your locally stored information.

**4. Data Security**

All data is stored securely using your browser's local storage API, which is protected by the browser's native security features. Since no data is transmitted to an external server, the risks associated with data breaches are minimized.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the policy on this page.

**6. Contact the Developer**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the extension, please contact me at **decayblock@gmail.com**.
